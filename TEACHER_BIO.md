# Bio & Blurb:

Hi, 

My name is Alexis Meade. I'm the Technical Art Director at Vela Games. 
I've been making games for over twenty years. I have experience in massive scale AAA titles such as World of Warcraft, and Diablo. 
I also have worked on small indy style titles, such as Evercore Heroes and God of War (PSP).

My experience has taught me that programming is a critical skill in a Technical Artist, but it has also taught me that it’s not a skill that is commonly taught.
I had to learn it on the job. While I have a Bachelor of Science in Animation, and a certificate from Gnomon, Python was something I had to learn on my own.
I can't express how much Python has improved my work and guided my career. I want to share some of that passion with you.

This is a beginner’s course in Python programming. No previous scripting or programming skills are needed.
Here you will learn the basics of Python from the ground up.
We will review how to set up Python on your computer, how to work with Git, and how professionals use Python on their day to day.

I’m excited to take this journey with you.
